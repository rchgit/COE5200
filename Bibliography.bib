Since this problem is highly ill-posed, a prior is needed in order to regularize it. The liter- ature offers various ways to address this problem, ranging from simple linear space-invariant interpolation schemes (e.g., bicubic interpolation), to spatially-adaptive and non-linear filters of various sorts. We embark from a recently-proposed successful algorithm by Yang et. al. [13,14], and similarly assume a local Sparse-Land model on image patches, serving as regularization. Several important modifications to the above-mentioned solution are introduced, and are shown to lead to improved results. These modifications include a major simplification of the overall process both in terms of the computational complexity and the algorithm architecture, using a different training approach for the dictionary-pair, and introducing the ability to operate without a training- set by boot-strapping the scale-up task from the given low-resolution image. We demonstrate the results on true images, showing both visual and PSNR improvements.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to single-image superresolution, based upon sparse signal representation. Research on image statistics suggests that image patches can be well-represented as a sparse linear combination of elements from an appropriately chosen over-complete dictionary. Inspired by this observation, we seek a sparse representation for each patch of the low-resolution input, and then use the coefficients of this representation to generate the high-resolution output. Theoretical results from compressed sensing suggest that under mild conditions, the sparse representation can be correctly recovered from the downsampled signals. By jointly training two dictionaries for the low- and high-resolution image patches, we can enforce the similarity of sparse representations between the low-resolution and high-resolution image patch pair with respect to their own dictionaries. Therefore, the sparse representation of a low-resolution image patch can be applied with the high-resolution image patch dictionary to generate a high-resolution image patch. The learned dictionary pair is a more compact representation of the patch pairs, compared to previous approaches, which simply sample a large amount of image patch pairs , reducing the computational cost substantially. The effectiveness of such a sparsity prior is demonstrated for both general image super-resolution (SR) and the special case of face hallucination. In both cases, our algorithm generates high-resolution images that are competitive or even superior in quality to images produced by other similar SR methods. In addition, the local sparse modeling of our approach is naturally robust to noise, and therefore the proposed algorithm can handle SR with noisy inputs in a more unified framework.},

	abstract = {As a powerful statistical image modeling technique, sparse representation has been successfully used in various image restoration applications. The success of sparse representation owes to the development of the l(1)-norm optimization techniques and the fact that natural images are intrinsically sparse in some domains. The image restoration quality largely depends on whether the employed sparse domain can represent well the underlying image. Considering that the contents can vary significantly across different images or different patches in a single image, we propose to learn various sets of bases from a precollected dataset of example image patches, and then, for a given patch to be processed, one set of bases are adaptively selected to characterize the local sparse domain. We further introduce two adaptive regularization terms into the sparse representation framework. First, a set of autoregressive (AR) models are learned from the dataset of example image patches. The best fitted AR models to a given patch are adaptively selected to regularize the image local structures. Second, the image nonlocal self-similarity is introduced as another regularization term. In addition, the sparsity regularization parameter is adaptively estimated for better image restoration performance. Extensive experiments on image deblurring and super-resolution validate that by using adaptive sparse domain selection and adaptive regularization, the proposed method achieves much better results than many state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both PSNR and visual perception.},

An adaptive incremental video super-resolution framework with the temporal consistency constraint is proposed in this paper. The temporal consistency among the video frames is enforced by imposing the similarity between the adjacent reconstructed HR frames. The variances of the potential functions, which affect the weights of the different terms in the utility function, are adaptively determined so that the algorithm is robust to various motion and image content situations. Some considerations, such as the incremental motion estimation, are also incorporated to improve the efficiency of the algorithm, which makes the proposed algorithm near-realtime.

	abstract = {A computationally simple super-resolution algorithm using a type of adaptive Wiener filter is proposed. The algorithm produces an improved resolution image from a sequence of low-resolution (LR) video frames with overlapping field of view. The algorithm uses subpixel registration to position each LR pixel value on a common spatial grid that is referenced to the average position of the input frames. The positions of the LR pixels are not quantized to a finite grid as with some previous techniques. The output high-resolution (HR) pixels are obtained using a weighted sum of LR pixels in a local moving window. Using a statistical model, the weights for each HR pixel are designed to minimize the mean squared error and they depend on the relative positions of the surrounding LR pixels. Thus, these weights adapt spatially and temporally to changing distributions of LR pixels due to varying motion. Both a global and spatially varying statistical model are considered here. Since the weights adapt with distribution of LR pixels, it is quite robust and will not become unstable when an unfavorable distribution of LR pixels is observed. For translational motion, the algorithm has a low computational complexity and may be readily suitable for real-time and/or near real-time processing applications. With other motion models, the computational complexity goes up significantly. However, regardless of the motion model, the algorithm lends itself to parallel implementation. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated here in a number of experimental results using simulated and real video sequences. A computational analysis is also presented.},

In existing systems, either the motion models are oversimplified or important factors such as blur kernel and noise level are assumed to be known. Such models cannot capture the intrinsic characteristics that may differ from one sequence to another. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to adaptive video super resolution via simultaneously estimating underlying motion, blur kernel, and noise level while reconstructing the original high-resolution frames. As a result, our system not only produces very promising super resolution results outperforming the state of the art, but also adapts to a variety of noise levels and blur kernels. To further analyze the effect of noise and blur kernel, we perform a two-step analysis using the Cramer-Rao bounds. We study how blur kernel and noise influence motion estimation with aliasing signals, how noise affects super resolution with perfect motion, and finally how blur kernel and noise influence super resolution with unknown motion. Our analysis results confirm empirical observations, in particular that an intermediate size blur kernel achieves the optimal image reconstruction results.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a fast deblurring method that produces a deblur- ring result from a single image of moderate size in a few seconds. We accelerate both latent image estimation and kernel estimation in an iterative deblurring process by introducing a novel prediction step and working with image derivatives rather than pixel values. In the prediction step, we use simple image processing techniques to predict strong edges from an estimated latent image, which will be solely used for kernel estimation. With this approach, a compu- tationally efficient Gaussian prior becomes sufficient for deconvo- lution to estimate the latent image, as small deconvolution artifacts can be suppressed in the prediction. For kernel estimation, we for- mulate the optimization function using image derivatives, and ac- celerate the numerical process by reducing the number of Fourier transforms needed for a conjugate gradient method. We also show that the formulation results in a smaller condition number of the nu- merical system than the use of pixel values, which gives faster con- vergence. Experimental results demonstrate that our method runs an order of magnitude faster than previous work, while the deblur- ring quality is comparable. GPU implementation facilitates further speed-up, making our method fast enough for practical use.},

We propose a framework for both magnification and deblurring using only the original low-resolution image and its blurred version. In our method, each pixel is predicted by its neighbors through the Gaussian process regression. We show that when using a proper covariance function, the Gaussian process regression can perform soft clustering of pixels based on their local structures. We further demonstrate that our algorithm can extract adequate information contained in a single low-resolution image to generate a high-resolution image with sharp edges, which is comparable to or even superior in quality to the performance of other edge-directed and example-based super-resolution algorithms. Experimental results also show that our approach maintains high-quality performance at large magnifications.},

	abstract = {In this study, a classification-based video super-resolution method using artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to enhance low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR) frames. The proposed method consists of four main steps: classification, motion-trace volume collection, temporal adjustment, and ANN prediction. A classifier is designed based on the edge properties of a pixel in the LR frame to identify the spatial information. To exploit the spatio-temporal information, a motion-trace volume is collected using motion estimation, which can eliminate unfathomable object motion in the LR frames. In addition, temporal lateral process is employed for volume adjustment to reduce unnecessary temporal features. Finally, ANN is applied to each class to learn the complicated spatio-temporal relationship between LR and HR frames. Simulation results show that the proposed method successfully improves both peak signal-to-noise ratio and perceptual quality. Â© 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a robust single-image super-resolution method for enlarging low quality web image/video degraded by downsampling and compression. To simultaneously improve the resolution and perceptual quality of such web image/video, we bring forward a practical solution which combines adaptive regularization and learning-based super-resolution. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we propose to analyze the image energy change characteristics during the iterative regularization process, i.e., the energy change ratio between primitive (e.g., edges, ridges and corners) and nonprimitive fields. Based on the revealed convergence property of the energy change ratio, appropriate regularization strength can then be determined to well balance compression artifacts removal and primitive components preservation. Second, we verify that this adaptive regularization can steadily and greatly improve the pair matching accuracy in learning-based super-resolution. Consequently, their combination effectively eliminates the quantization noise and meanwhile faithfully compensates the missing high-frequency details, yielding robust super-resolution performance in the compression scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution produces visually pleasing enlargements for various web images/videos.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to single-image super-resolution, based on sparse signal representation. Research on image statistics suggests that image patches can be well-represented as a sparse linear combination of elements from an appropriately chosen over-complete dictionary. Inspired by this observation, we seek a sparse representation for each patch of the low-resolution input, and then use the coefficients of this representation to generate the high-resolution output. Theoretical results from compressed sensing suggest that under mild conditions, the sparse representation can be correctly recovered from the downsampled signals. By jointly training two dictionaries for the low- and high-resolution image patches, we can enforce the similarity of sparse representations between the low resolution and high resolution image patch pair with respect to their own dictionaries. Therefore, the sparse representation of a low resolution image patch can be applied with the high resolution image patch dictionary to generate a high resolution image patch. The learned dictionary pair is a more compact representation of the patch pairs, compared to previous approaches, which simply sample a large amount of image patch pairs [1], reducing the computational cost substantially. The effectiveness of such a sparsity prior is demonstrated for both general image super-resolution and the special case of face hallucination. In both cases, our algorithm generates high-resolution images that are competitive or even superior in quality to images produced by other similar SR methods. In addition, the local sparse modeling of our approach is naturally robust to noise, and therefore the proposed algorithm can handle super-resolution with noisy inputs in a more unified framework.},

@article{Caner2003,
	abstract = { In many surveillance video applications, it is of interest to recognize an object or a person, which occupies a small portion of a low-resolution, noisy video. This paper addresses the problem of super-resolution recovery of a region of interest from more than one low-resolution view of a scene recorded by multiple cameras. The multiple camera scenario alleviates the difficulty in registration of multiple frames of video that contain non-rigid or multiple object motion in the single camera case. With proper temporal registration of multiple videos, arbitrary scene motion can be handled. The success of super-resolution recovery from multiple views in real applications vitally depends on two factors: i) the accuracy of multiple view registration results, and ii) the accuracy of the camera and data acquisition model. We propose a system, which consists of a method for sub-pixel accurate spatio-temporal alignment of multiple video sequences for view registration and the projections onto convex sets method for super-resolution recovery. Experiments were implemented using two commercial analog video cameras, which do not perform on-board compression. Experimental results show that the super resolution recovery of dynamic scenes can be achieved as long as the multiple views of the scene can be registered with sub-pixel accuracy.},

abstract = {The high density image sensors of state-of-the-art imaging systems provide outputs with high spatial resolution, but require long exposure times. This limits their applicability, due to the motion blur effect. Recent technological advances have lead to adaptive image sensors that can combine several pixels together in real time to form a larger pixel. Larger pixels require shorter exposure times and produce high-frame-rate samples with reduced motion blur. This work proposes combining an FPGA with an adaptive image sensor to produce an output of high resolution both in space and time. The FPGA is responsible for the spatial resolution enhancement of the high-frame-rate samples using super-resolution (SR) techniques in real time. To achieve it, this article proposes utilizing the Iterative Back Projection (IBP) SR algorithm. The original IBP method is modified to account for the presence of noise, leading to an algorithm more robust to noise. An FPGA implementation of this algorithm is presented. The proposed architecture can serve as a general purpose real-time resolution enhancement system, and its performance is evaluated under various noise levels.},

It is well established that certain sequential applications can be captured spatially and achieve breathtaking speedups when run on an FPGA, but why? Despite running at clock speeds orders of magnitude slower compared to their embedded processor equivalents, FPGA applications can "lose" enough cycles to create exceptionally fast spatially-oriented circuits. We profile and analyze three canonical applications amenable to FPGA speedup to quantify exactly where FPGAs gain that speedup. We compare the FPGA implementations to several idealized software platforms. The idealized software platforms give insight as to how FPGA implementations attain such dramatic speedups. We quantify the effects of parallelizing and pipelining instructions, streaming data, and eliminating the instruction fetch, showing exactly where the cycles are lost in an FPGA implementation. We also show how the memory interface to the FPGA will affect the performance. Our results show that custom memory interfaces are the most effective way at enabling much greater performance on the FPGA, and that memory interfaces traditional software use become a bottleneck when the FPGA uses the same interface. The results, though not surprising, provide a clearer and more intuitive understanding of the performance FPGAs can achieve, offering researchers and engineers alike a new angle to attack the task of parallelizing applications.},
