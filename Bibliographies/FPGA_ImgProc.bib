abstract = {This thesis describes the use of current day low cost Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for realtime broadcast video processing. Capabilities of selected device family (Altera Cyclone IV) are discussed with regard to video process- ing. Example IP cores (deinterlacer, alpha blender and frame rate converter) are designed in Verilog HDL and the design flow is described. The IP cores are im- plemented in real hardware system. The overall hardware system is described, together with individual FPGA components providing video input/output and other I/O functions.},

@article{Draper2000,
abstract = {This paper presents a high-level language for expressing image
processing algorithms, and an optimizing compiler that targets FPGAs.
The language is called SA-C, and this paper focuses on the language
features that 1) support image processing, and 2) enable efficient
compilation to FPGAs. It then describes the compilation process, in
which SA-C algorithms are translated into non-recursive data flow
graphs, which in turn are translated into VHDL. Finally, it presents
performance numbers for some well-known image processing routines,
written in SAC and automatically compiled to an Annapolis Microsystems
WildForce board with Xilinx 4036XL FPGAs},
