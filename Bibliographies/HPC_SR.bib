abstract = {Localization-based super resolution microscopy holds superior performances in live cell imaging, but its widespread use is thus far mainly hindered by the slow image analysis speed. Here we show a powerful image analysis method based on the combination of the maximum likelihood algorithm and a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Results indicate that our method is fast enough for real-time processing of experimental images even from fast EMCCD cameras working at full frame rate without compromising localization precision or field of view. This newly developed method is also capable of revealing movements from the images immediately after data acquisition, which is of great benefit to live cell imaging.},

@article{Angelopoulou2009,
abstract = {The high density image sensors of state-of-the-art imaging systems provide outputs with high spatial resolution, but require long exposure times. This limits their applicability, due to the motion blur effect. Recent technological advances have lead to adaptive image sensors that can combine several pixels together in real time to form a larger pixel. Larger pixels require shorter exposure times and produce high-frame-rate samples with reduced motion blur. This work proposes combining an FPGA with an adaptive image sensor to produce an output of high resolution both in space and time. The FPGA is responsible for the spatial resolution enhancement of the high-frame-rate samples using super-resolution (SR) techniques in real time. To achieve it, this article proposes utilizing the Iterative Back Projection (IBP) SR algorithm. The original IBP method is modified to account for the presence of noise, leading to an algorithm more robust to noise. An FPGA implementation of this algorithm is presented. The proposed architecture can serve as a general purpose real-time resolution enhancement system, and its performance is evaluated under various noise levels.},

@article{Camargo2010,
abstract = {Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) have been used in many military and civilian applications, particularly surveillance. One of the best ways to use the capacity of a UAS imaging system is by constructing a mosaic of the recorded video. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm to calculate a super-resolution mosaic for UAS, which is both fast and robust. In this algorithm, the features points between frames are found using SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), and then RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) is used to estimate the homography between two consecutive frames. Next, a low-resolution (LR) mosaic is computed. LR images are extracted from the LR mosaic, and then they are subtracted from the input frames to form LR error images. These images are used to compute an error mosaic. The regularization technique uses Huber prior information and is added to the error mosaic to form the superresolution (SR) mosaic. The proposed algorithm was implemented using both a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) and a CPU (Central Processing Unit). The first part of the algorithm, which is the construction of the LR mosaic, is performed by the GPU, and the rest is performed by the CPU. As a result, there is a significant speed-up of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm has been tested in both the infrared (IR) and visible spectra, using real and synthetic data. The results for all these cases show a great improvement in resolution, with a PSNR of 41.10 dB for synthetic data, and greater visual detail for the real UAV surveillance data.},

abstract = {Super resolution is a process to generate high-resolution images from their low-resolution versions. In many applications such as super-HD (4K) TV, super resolution has to be performed in real time. In this paper we propose a real-time image/video super-resolution algorithm, which achieves good performance at low computational cost via off-line learning of interpolation errors in different pixel contexts. The proposed algorithm consists of three stages: fast edge-guided interpolation to generate an initial HR estimation, GPU-aided de-convolution, and error feedback compensation. All three stages can be implemented with GPU to support real-time applications. Experiments demonstrate the competitive performance of the new real-time super-resolution algorithm in both PSNR and visual quality.},
