abstract = {We address the image denoising problem, where zeromean white and homogeneous Gaussian additive noise should be removed from a given image. The approach taken is based on sparse and redundant representations over a trained dictionary. The proposed algorithm denoises the image, while simultaneously trainining a dictionary on its (corrupted) content using the K-SVD algorithm. As the dictionary training algorithm is limited in handling small image patches, we extend its deployment to arbitrary image sizes by defining a global image prior that forces sparsity over patches in every location in the image. We show how such Bayesian treatment leads to a simple and effective denoising algorithm, with state-of-the-art performance, equivalent and sometimes surpassing recently published leading alternative denoising methods.},

abstract = { A new approach toward increasing spatial resolution is required to overcome the limitations of the sensors and optics manufacturing technology. One promising approach is to use signal processing techniques to obtain an high-resolution (HR) image (or sequence) from observed multiple low-resolution (LR) images. Such a resolution enhancement approach has been one of the most active research areas, and it is called super resolution (SR) (or HR) image reconstruction or simply resolution enhancement. In this article, we use the term "SR image reconstruction" to refer to a signal processing approach toward resolution enhancement because the term "super" in "super resolution" represents very well the characteristics of the technique overcoming the inherent resolution limitation of LR imaging systems. The major advantage of the signal processing approach is that it may cost less and the existing LR imaging systems can be still utilized. The SR image reconstruction is proved to be useful in many practical cases where multiple frames of the same scene can be obtained, including medical imaging, satellite imaging, and video applications. The goal of this article is to introduce the concept of SR algorithms to readers who are unfamiliar with this area and to provide a review for experts. To this purpose, we present the technical review of various existing SR methodologies which are often employed. Before presenting the review of existing SR algorithms, we first model the LR image acquisition process.},

These measures can be useful for the evaluation and comparison of different algorithms; designed to solve a particular problem. For example, one of the possible applications is the comparison of different filters for image noise reduction. It is well-known that classical quality measures, such as the MSE (mean square error) or the PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio), do not always correspond to visual observations. Therefore, several researchers are - and have been - looking for new quality measures, better adapted to human perception. The existing similarity measures are all pixel-based, and have therefore not always satisfactory results. To cope with this drawback, we propose a similarity measure based on a neighbourhood, so that the relevant structures of the images are observed very well. The new similarity measure is designed especially for use in image processing.},

The learning process enforces that the sparse representation of a low-resolution (LR) image patch in terms of the LR dictionary can well reconstruct its underlying HR image patch with the dictionary in the high-resolution image patch space. We model the learning problem as a bilevel opti- mization problem, where the optimization includes an ?1-norm minimization problemin its constraints. Implicit differentiation is employed to calculate the desired gradient for stochastic gradient descent. We demonstrate that our coupled dictionary learning method can outperform the existing joint dictionary training method both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, for real applications, we speed up the algorithm approximately 10 times by learning a neural network model for fast sparse infer- ence and selectively processing only those visually salient regions. Extensive experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art SR algorithms validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

abstract = {Super-resolution is a widely used technique to increase the resolution of an image by algorithmic methods. Super-resolution from a single image is required in many real world applications. But it is a challenging task to preserve the local edge structures and visual quality in single image super-resolution. Conventional as well as advanced methods maintain the quantitative measures, but most of the times they fail to preserve edges and visual quality. We propose here a single image super-resolution algorithm which preserves the edges and at the same time maintains the visual quality, in a relatively better way. In this method, self-examples are created from a high frequency layer which is formed by performing the difference operation between the given low-resolution image and down-scaled and subsequently up-scaled version of the low-resolution image. The proposed method computes the root mean square difference of features extracted from high frequency layers of low-resolution, interpolated high-resolution and partially reconstructed high-resolution images. These difference values are fed into a Gaussian function to compute the weights which are subsequently used to perform the weighted average. The experimental analysis proves the ability of the method in improving the visual quality as well as in preserving edge information. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

However, this is not true for SR because of one-to-many mappings between LR and HR patches. To overcome or at least to reduce the problem for NE-based SR reconstruction, we apply a joint learning technique to train two projection matrices simultaneously and to map the original LR and HR feature spaces onto a unified feature subspace. Subsequently, the k -nearest neighbor selection of the input LR image patches is conducted in the unified feature subspace to estimate the reconstruction weights. To handle a large number of samples, joint learning locally exploits a coupled constraint by linking the LR-HR counterparts together with the K-nearest grouping patch pairs. In order to refine further the initial SR estimate, we impose a global reconstruction constraint on the SR outcome based on the maximum a posteriori framework. Preliminary experiments suggest that the proposed algorithm outperforms NE-related baselines.},

Solution of such an integral equation when the data are corrupted by noise or experimental error is treated as the problem of finding an estimate that is a linear functional of the data and minimizes the mean squared error between the true solution and itself. The estimate depends on assumptions about the spectral densities of the images and the noise, the choice of which is discussed. Coherent optical processing and digital processing are described.},

abstract = {We propose a fast regression model for practical single image $\backslash$nsuper-resolution based on in-place examples, by leveraging two fundamental $\backslash$nsuper-resolution approaches- learning from an external database and learning $\backslash$nfrom self-examples. Our in-place self-similarity refines the recently proposed $\backslash$nlocal self-similarity by proving that a patch in the upper scale image have good $\backslash$nmatches around its origin location in the lower scale image. Based on the $\backslash$nin-place examples, a first-order approximation of the nonlinear mapping function $\backslash$nfrom low-to high-resolution image patches is learned. Extensive experiments on $\backslash$nbenchmark and real-world images demonstrate that our algorithm can produce $\backslash$nnatural-looking results with sharp edges and preserved fine details, while the $\backslash$ncurrent state-of-the-art algorithms are prone to visual artifacts. Furthermore, $\backslash$nour model can easily extend to deal with noise by combining the regression $\backslash$nresults on multiple in-place examples for robust estimation. The algorithm runs $\backslash$nfast and is particularly useful for practical applications, where the input $\backslash$nimages typically contain diverse textures and they are potentially contaminated $\backslash$nby noise or compression artifacts.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the single image scale-up problem us- ing sparse-representation modeling. The goal is to recover an original image from its blurred and down-scaled noisy version. Since this problem is highly ill-posed, a prior is needed in order to regularize it. The liter- ature offers various ways to address this problem, ranging from simple linear space-invariant interpolation schemes (e.g., bicubic interpolation), to spatially-adaptive and non-linear filters of various sorts. We embark from a recently-proposed successful algorithm by Yang et. al. [13,14], and similarly assume a local Sparse-Land model on image patches, serving as regularization. Several important modifications to the above-mentioned solution are introduced, and are shown to lead to improved results. These modifications include a major simplification of the overall process both in terms of the computational complexity and the algorithm architecture, using a different training approach for the dictionary-pair, and introducing the ability to operate without a training- set by boot-strapping the scale-up task from the given low-resolution image. We demonstrate the results on true images, showing both visual and PSNR improvements.},

abstract = {Recently there have been significant advances in image up scaling or $\backslash$nimage super-resolution based on a dictionary of low and high resolution $\backslash$nexemplars. The running time of the methods is often ignored despite the fact $\backslash$nthat it is a critical factor for real applications. This paper proposes fast $\backslash$nsuper-resolution methods while making no compromise on quality. First, we $\backslash$nsupport the use of sparse learned dictionaries in combination with neighbor $\backslash$nembedding methods. In this case, the nearest neighbors are computed using the $\backslash$ncorrelation with the dictionary atoms rather than the Euclidean distance. $\backslash$nMoreover, we show that most of the current approaches reach top performance for $\backslash$nthe right parameters. Second, we show that using global collaborative coding has $\backslash$nconsiderable speed advantages, reducing the super-resolution mapping to a $\backslash$nprecomputed projective matrix. Third, we propose the anchored neighborhood $\backslash$nregression. That is to anchor the neighborhood embedding of a low resolution $\backslash$npatch to the nearest atom in the dictionary and to precompute the corresponding $\backslash$nembedding matrix. These proposals are contrasted with current state-of-the-art $\backslash$nmethods on standard images. We obtain similar or improved quality and one or two $\backslash$norders of magnitude speed improvements.},

@article{Yang2010,
abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to single-image superresolution, based upon sparse signal representation. Research on image statistics suggests that image patches can be well-represented as a sparse linear combination of elements from an appropriately chosen over-complete dictionary. Inspired by this observation, we seek a sparse representation for each patch of the low-resolution input, and then use the coefficients of this representation to generate the high-resolution output. Theoretical results from compressed sensing suggest that under mild conditions, the sparse representation can be correctly recovered from the downsampled signals. By jointly training two dictionaries for the low- and high-resolution image patches, we can enforce the similarity of sparse representations between the low-resolution and high-resolution image patch pair with respect to their own dictionaries. Therefore, the sparse representation of a low-resolution image patch can be applied with the high-resolution image patch dictionary to generate a high-resolution image patch. The learned dictionary pair is a more compact representation of the patch pairs, compared to previous approaches, which simply sample a large amount of image patch pairs , reducing the computational cost substantially. The effectiveness of such a sparsity prior is demonstrated for both general image super-resolution (SR) and the special case of face hallucination. In both cases, our algorithm generates high-resolution images that are competitive or even superior in quality to images produced by other similar SR methods. In addition, the local sparse modeling of our approach is naturally robust to noise, and therefore the proposed algorithm can handle SR with noisy inputs in a more unified framework.},
