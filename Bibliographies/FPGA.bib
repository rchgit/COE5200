abstract = {As systems become more complex and designers are asked to do more with less, FPGA adaptability has become a critical asset. While Xilinx® FPGAs have always provided the flexibility to do on-site device reprogramming, today’s tougher cost, board space, and power consumption constraints demand even more efficient design strategies.},
